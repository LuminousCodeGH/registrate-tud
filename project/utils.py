    """
    Create a webdriver for use in the Scraper class. NOTE: In order for this to work you will have to download
    a version of the chrome or firefox webdriver. Check the README.md for steps on how to download and set it up.

    Args:
        browser (str, 'firefox' | 'chrome'): Select which browser the driver should use. NOTE: Chrome gives
            seemingly random warnings when using that driver, so Firefox is recommended. Though, so far there have not
            been any performance issues with Chrome despite the warnings.
        is_headless (bool, optional): Whether or not to hide the browser window when the driver
            is being run. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Chrome | Firefox | None: The driver which will be used for scraping. In case there is an error, returns None.
